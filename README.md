## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- grid
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Regular Expression
- React
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### CSS

This project is the first time that I learn to use the animation for real. Combining with the ability to transition the element, this give me the power to manipulate the DOM in the way that I want and it still quite beautiful. I also learn to change the properties of background image to fit the description. I implement some grid to the landing page too, although it is quite terrible use for the website like this and that make me learned that some tools are best for only some situation. I have to use the right tools for the right job. but overall I learned a lot of CSS here and have a lot of fun playing with it.

#### JavaScript

I don't learn anything much about JavaScript in this project, maybe because there are quite many things that I knew already. Anyway I use a lot of switch statement here and that make me familiarize with it and may prefer using it in some case in the future for if/else statement alternative.

#### React

With this landing page, I learned a lot about React. I use UseEffect for the first time and I kind of actually like how it work. Also this give me a lot of knowledge about their dependency. But the thing that I think is help me the most in this project is the knowledge of how the rendering and re-rendering work. I need to keep in mind from now on about rendering in React in the future. Also I have a chance to try out most of React hooks in this project. Even I didn't use many of it to complete the project I now plan to use it more in my next project.

#### Regular Expression

This is the first time I use RegEx to validate form in the project. At first it quite intimidating, but after I've learned the basic of RegEx, it not that hard at all. I will sure love to work with it again anytime I have an input with the needed of validation.

### Continued development

This landing page is kind of past-time project for me, yet it show me a lot of stuffs and make me learn of many kind of things. And that give me the need to learn more and dig deep in some area that I find it useful and not quite understand it completely yet. Here the list of what I want to learn next.

- React hooks
- CSS animation
- JavaScript object
- Async JavaScript
- React lifecycle
- HTML forms
